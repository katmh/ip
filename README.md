# What's an IP address? How are they allocated? Are we running out?

An interactive exploration of what IPv4 addresses are, how networks and hosts are represented, and more.

Built with [Idyll](https://idyll-lang.org), a React-based toolkit for data-driven stoies and exlorable explanations.

Thanks to [Theo](https://tmb.sh) for enlightening me about IP basics and [Lachlan](https://lachlanjc.me) for transformative design feedback :)
