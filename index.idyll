Every device on the Internet has a address. Similar to the way your [Color color:"#444"]street address[/Color] has a [Color color:"maroon"]street name[/Color] and [Color color:"navy"]building number[/Color], an [Color color:"#444"]IP address[/Color] is made of a [Color color:"maroon"]network[/Color] and [Color color:"navy"]host[/Color]. Hosts, like computers or printers, are part of a group of devices that communicate with one another.

You may have seen IP addresses before: 4 numbers separated by dots. Each number represents 8 bits, or binary digits: [Code]0[/Code]s and [Code]1[/Code]s.

In theory, we have [Latex]$2^{32} = 4,294,967,296$[/Latex] IP addresses â€” over 4 billion. But there are already over 4.66 billion people in the world who use the Internet, and many of them have multiple devices. As you might guess, we're using up all the IP addresses. Who owns them and how did we get here? What's next?

The IP address space is managed globally by the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority), and by five regional Internet registries (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to local Internet registries, such as Internet service providers (ISPs), and other end users.

In practice, certain ranges of numbers are reserved. The example used above, [Code]192.168.0.0[/Code], is a private, or unroutable, IP address. Your computer understands [Code]127.0.0.1[/Code], or localhost, to mean its own IP address.

IPv4 addresses were distributed by IANA to the RIRs in blocks of approximately 16.8 million addresses each, but have been exhausted at the IANA level since January 2011. The main market forces that accelerated IPv4 address depletion included the rapidly growing number of Internet users, always-on devices, and mobile devices.

Many organizations needed more IPs than Class C could provide, but didn't use nearly as many as Class B offered. This become a problem especially during the dot com boom, as droves of people and companies went online. 

The creators of the Internet anticipated the IP shortage. They developed network address translation (NAT), where multiple private addresses are placed under one public address. In 1993, they developed Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR, pronounced cider), a less wasteful and more flexible system than the previous class-based one.

    "Each pixel in the full-size image represents a single /24 network containing up to 256 hosts. The color of each pixel corresponds to the Regional Internet Registries where the address space is listed."

    "Areas are shaded with varying levels of transparency. Larger blocks of address space are more transparent, which also makes them darker. Thus, varying shades of a color indicate different-sized blocks of addresses appearing in the whois data."

    Owners include various registries, the US Department of Defense, and telecom companies.

## An abundance of IPs

As one of the early pioneers of the Internet, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, among other schools, received a huge chunk of IP addresses back in the day.

## What do we do since we're running out?

CIDR has worked well, but we have IPv6
